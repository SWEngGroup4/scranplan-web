<p>Data is typically passed to us either by our users directly: for example by signing up to the service and entering their personal details such as their email address, or it is passed to us by businesses or organisations they’re associated with.</p>

<p>When users first login or signup they are asked to consent to this document by the system, which records them having done so.</p>

<h3 id="lawful-fair-and-transparent-processing">Lawful, fair and transparent processing</h3>

    <li>Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in  consent shall be kept with the personal data.</li>
    <li>Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the service’s systems.</li>

    <li>To help provide fantastic service and support, certain directors, employees and volunteers may login to any user’s account, at any time, without notifying them.</li>
    <li>As provided for by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 or any corresponding statute, the Service’s directors, employees and volunteers reserve the right to investigate and inspect electronic communications.</li>
    <li>As required for operational reasons, user data may be released to other users to enable them to execute their role functions - for example your email address will be shared with other users to allow them to contact you in relation to events.</li>
    <li>The service may release data for analytical purposes to external providers but this data will either be anonymised or stored in line with this document.</li>
    <li>When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable, in liason with the service’s storage contractors.</li>
    <li>Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place.</li>
    <li>In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, the service shall promptly assess the risk to people’s rights and freedoms and if appropriate report this breach to the ICO in the United Kingdom.</li>
